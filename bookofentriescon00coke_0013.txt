.- ι, What rever-‘enee harh been given by the most Reverend Sages of
the Law to judicial Prefidents, appeareth (amongst many others) in

s Effice cast in 39 H.6.fi›l73o.where the opinion of learned Prisot Chief

Justice of the Court of common PleaS,and other Justiees,was,Thar

in a Writ of Mesne,qne le pl' covient le finefhrce de ficrmitter le tenure

de les novel Tales, ὠ· enfimen't que ils avoyent view que les Tales nefe-

No man ἓ] be a compleat Lawyer bylun'iversality of knowledge
without experience in particular Case5‚ nor by bare experience with-
out universality of knowledge3he must be both speculative ὃς aCtive‚
for thescience of the Laws, I affure you, must joyn hands with ex-
perience. Experientia (saith the great Philosopher) est cognitio fingula-
rium, ars vero universalium. The learned Sages of the Law do found
their J udgment upon legal Reason and judicial Prefident 3 the one
they find in our Books of Years and Terms‚the other out of Records
formerly examIned and allowed z These two, Reason and Preficleat
ate clariffim‘a mundi lumina, Whereby all the wife men of the world are
diressed J But in these days of many it may be justlv said, Qodftatzm
fizpium,stat'imsciunt omnia, neminem verentur, inurantur neminem, ipsc
fibi exem lasunt. But it is safe for the Client and for the Couneellor
also (if e respe& his Conscience) to follow Presldents formerly ap-
' 1 proved and allowed, and not to trust to any new frarne carved out of
his own invention, for Nihilfimnl inventum ὢν perfeffum e fl .

,ι The former Book of Entries being published at that time when the
Author was beyond the Seas ζ as in his Prefaee he confesseth) could
nor so exaffly and perFeCUy be done (though it be for many Presl-
dents therein,very profitable and of good uso) as if he had been at the
Eountains Head it self2and might have had conference with the grave
Judges, and well experienced prothonotaries„ Officers, and Clarks.

Δ In this Book fix things are worthy of observation. Fstst, that none
of the Presldents herein have been by any publifhed hererofore. Se-
condly‚ Thac they are of greaterlauthority and use, 'and fitter for the
moder11Pra6³tise of theLaw,for that they be for the most part of later
times, 8< principally, of the reign of our late Soveraign Lady of ever
bleffed memory Qeen Elizaheth, and of his most Excellent Maje‘
sty the King that now is. Thirdly, that for thy further satisfaifion
(Learned Reader) every Prefident harh atrue reference to the court,
Ye'ar', Term, Number-roll, and R ecord3 where the Prefident ic self is
to be found. Fourthly‚ In this work are contained the Records of di-
vers of the Cases which in the nine former Parts of my Commentaries I

have published,with a certain reference to the Report it self. Fifthlv,

Here ¹shall you find Prefidents adjudged upon Demurrer, wherein

lie hidden many matters of LaW, and excellent points of Learngng²
